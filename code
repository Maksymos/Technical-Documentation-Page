				Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term, usually years or decades. Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security.

			<header>How to invest with confidence</header>
			<p>The investment landscape can be extremely dynamic and ever-evolving. But those who take the time to understand the basic principles and the different asset classes stand to gain significantly over the long haul. The first step: learning to distinguish different types of investments and what rung each occupies on the "risk ladder."</p>
			<code>KEY TAKEAWAYS</code>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Investing can be a daunting prospect for beginners, with an enormous variety of possible assets to add to a portfolio.
				</li>
				<li>
					The investment 'risk ladder' identifies asset classes based on their relative riskiness, with cash being the most stable and alternative investments often being the most volatile.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sticking with index funds or exchange-traded funds that mirror the market is often the best path for a new investor.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Understanding the Investment 'Risk Ladder'</h4>
				<p>
					Here are the major asset classes, in ascending order of risk, on the investment risk ladder.
				</p>
			<h4>Cash</h4>
				<p>
					A cash bank deposit is the simplest, most easily understandable investment asset—and the safest. Not only does it give investors precise knowledge of the interest they'll earn, but it also guarantees they'll get their capital back. On the downside, the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are highly liquid instruments, very similar to cash that are instruments that typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, money is locked up for a period of time and there are potential early withdrawal penalties involved.
				</p>
			<h4>Bonds</h4>
				<p>
					A bond is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A typical bond will involve either a corporation or a government agency, where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate to the lender in exchange for using their capital. Bonds are commonplace in organizations that use them in order to finance operations, purchases, or other projects.
					<br>
					Bond rates are essentially determined by the interest rates. Due to this, they are heavily traded during periods of quantitative easing or when the Federal Reserve—or other central banks—raise interest rates.
				</p>
			<h4>Stocks</h4>
				<p>
					Shares of stock let investors participate in the company’s success via increases in the stock’s price and through dividends. Shareholders have a claim on the company’s assets in the event of liquidation (that is, the company going bankrupt) but do not own the assets. Holders of common stock enjoy voting rights at shareholders’ meetings. Holders of preferred stock don’t have voting rights but do receive preference over common shareholders in terms of the dividend payments.
				</p>
			<h4>Mutual Funds</h4>
				<p>
					A mutual fund is a type of investment where more than one investor pools their money together in order to purchase securities. Mutual funds are not necessarily passive, as they are managed by portfolio managers who allocate and distribute the pooled investment into stocks, bonds, and other securities. Individuals may invest in mutual funds for as little as $1,000/share, letting them diversify into as many as 100 different stocks contained within a given portfolio.
					<br>
					Mutual funds are sometimes designed to mimic underlying indexes such as the S&P 500 or DOW Industrial Index. There are also many mutual funds that are actively managed, meaning they are updated by portfolio managers who carefully track and adjust their allocations within the fund. However, these funds generally have greater costs—such as yearly management fees and front-end charges—which can cut into an investor's returns.
					<br>
					Mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day, and all buy and sell transactions are likewise executed after the market closes.
				</p>
			<h4>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h4>
				<p>
					Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become quite popular since their introduction back in the mid-1990s. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they trade throughout the day, on a stock exchange. In this way, they mirror the buy-and-sell behavior of stocks. This also means their value can change drastically during the course of a trading day.
					<br>
					ETFs can track an underlying index such as the S&P 500 or any other "basket" of stocks the issuer of the ETF wants to underline a specific ETF with. This can include anything from emerging markets, commodities, individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture, and more. Due to the ease of trading and broad coverage, ETFs are extremely popular with investors.

			<p>Investing requires saving money to invest, then developing a diversified portfolio. Portfolios need to be adjusted periodically based on life changes, but the focus should remain on the long term.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="portfolio_management" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
			<header>Portfolio management</header>
				<p>
					Portfolio management consists of three main elements: investing time horizon, diversification of investments, and risk tolerance.
				</p>
				<h4>Diversification</h4>
					<p>
						WHAT IS DIVERSIFICATION?
						Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.
						<br>
						THE BASICS OF DIVERSIFICATION
						Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.
						<br>
						Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. The investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, albeit at a drastically smaller rate.
					</p>
					<code>KEY TAKEAWAYS</code>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio.
							</li>
							<li>
								Portfolio holdings can be diversified across asset classes and within classes, and also geographically—by investing in both domestic and foreign markets.
							</li>
							<li>
								Diversification limits portfolio risk but can also mitigate performance, at least in the short term.
							</li>
						</ul>
					<code>Diversification by Asset Class</code>
					<p>
						Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Classes can include:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Stocks-shares or equity in a publicly traded company
							</li>
							<li>
								Bonds-government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments
							</li>
							<li>
								Real estate-land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits
							</li>
							<li>
								Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)-a marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector
							</li>
							<li>
								Commodities-basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services
							</li>
							<li>
								Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE)-Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments
							</li>
						</ul>

				Portfolio managers develop asset management models based on age, income, time to retirement, etc. They then plug your variables into their model to determine your so-called individualized portfolio.

			<h3>Investing 2020: The Future of Finance</h3>
			<p>
				It’s hard to believe that the first iPhone came out just a little over 12 years ago. It's even harder to imagine life without our smartphones. The past decade has seen a tornado of innovation that's mixed our personal lives and our digital lives in an inseparable cocktail that will define this century and beyond. Nowhere has this combination been so powerful than in our wallets.
				<br>
				The finance industry has always been at the forefront of innovation through technology, and for good reason. From open outcry trading at physical exchanges to high-frequency and algorithmic trading via ultra-fast networks; from paper savings account passbooks to robo-advisors that track our spending and investing, technological innovation has been a priority for financial institutions and consumers alike, both eager to make their transactions as fluid as possible.

			<header>Fundamental analysis</header>
			<p>
				Fundamental analysis attempts to measure a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors including the balance sheet, strategic initiatives, microeconomic indicators, and consumer behavior.
				<br>
				Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management.
				<br>
				The end goal is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued.
				<br>
				This method of stock analysis is considered to be in contrast to technical analysis, which forecasts the direction of prices through an analysis of historical market data such as price and volume.

				<code>KEY TAKEAWAYS</code>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fundamental analysis is a method of determining a stock's real or "fair market" value.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fundamental analysts search for stocks that are currently trading at prices that are higher or lower than their real value.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the fair market value is higher than the market price, the stock is deemed to be undervalued and a buy recommendation is given.
						</li>
						<li>
							In contrast, technical analysts ignore the fundamentals in favor of studying the historical price trends of the stock.
